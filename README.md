1. What were your considerations when creating this test data?

My biggest consideration was having a) enough data to use (which is why I used 10 responses) and b) enough varieties of times/scores/movie_ids. I also wanted to make sure that the datafile I created had tabs between each number.

2. Were there certain characteristics of the real data and file format that you made sure to capture in your test data?

I wanted to make sure the data had a tabs between each number and the timestamps could be converted to date/time. 

3. Did you create a reference solution for your test data? If so, how?

Yes I made sure to be able to create a dataframe object that could have 4 columns (user_id, movie_id, rating, timestamp), and that I could easily reference one of the items in it.
